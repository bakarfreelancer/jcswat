                <h3>PRINCIPAL MESSAGE</h3>
                <p class="principalMessagePara">
                I feel privileged, elated and honoured to pen down a message for the students of the historical institution of Govt.Posgraduate Jahanzeb College, Swat. Undoubtedly, Govt.Jahanzeb College is a trailblazer for the rest of the institutions in KPK because of its rich history, exceptional teaching and its vital role in the enlightenment, development, shaping and broadening the spectrum of thinking of its students over the years. In fact, many lucky students, who graduated from Jahanzeb College have always gone on to excellent careers, who are efficiently serving the nation and reputable institutions 0f the world in various capacities and earning good name for their beloved country Pakistan. Obviously, the credit for this monumental success goes to the exruler of Swat. Maj.Gen. Miangul Abdul Haq Jahanzeb,who laid the foundation of this towering, awesome and inspiring college in 1952, with the clear vision of steering Swat to a more progressive path of peace, prosperity and development. Though established in 1952 for a few hundred local students, but itâ€™s amazing that the college is in that original shape and is catering to the needs of thousands of students both local and from other parts of the province, which is the recognition of the fact college is growing in stature by the day.

                <p class="">His Highness, Miangul Abdul Haq Jahanzeb, the former ruler of Swat state, built a lot of schools in every corner of his domain, including the erection of the building of Jahanzeb College in 1952. The buildings of Jahanzeb College can be seen in clusters sprawling on both sides of the road that links Mingora Saidu Sharif.  </p>
